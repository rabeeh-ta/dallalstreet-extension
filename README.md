# About the project and usage

This is my final project of the [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/project/).

The extension helps quickly jump into all the major websites that are used to analyse a company.

For eg want to learn about a new company let say `ITC` you will need the financial from a website (screener.com, trendlyne.com) and see the technical's from another website(tradingview.com) also you might find the wikipedia usefull also maybe throw in the NSE and BSE websites.

You get the point google and opening all this different sites will take time.
